# JBang scripts for working with the GitHub REST API

This repo provides a number of JBang scripts I've used to help with administering large number of GitHub repositories.

The repository is named after the first such script.

## Prerequisites

- [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/) installed
- Java 21 or newer (JBang will install this if you don't already have it)
- GitHub credentials configured (see [Authentication](#authentication))

## Authentication

Policy Panda requires GitHub credentials in one of these forms:

- **Environment Variables**:
    - `GITHUB_OAUTH`: Your GitHub OAuth token
    - `GITHUB_JWT`: GitHub JWT token (alternative)

- **Property File**:
    - Create a `~/.github` file in your home directory with either:

        ```txt
        oauth=your_token_here
        ```

      or

        ```txt
        jwt=your_token_here
        ```

For more details, see [GitHub API Authentication](https://hub4j.github.io/github-api/#Authentication).

## GitFileAdder
JBang script for adding a one or more files to multiple repositories in a GitHub organization.

The use case that inspired this script was the need to add a Developer Certificate of Origin file to hundreds of repositories in the Github `wildfly` and `wildfly-extras` organization.

### Basic Usage

Clone the repo locally and then:


```shell
cd git-file-adder
jbang GitFileAdder.java -o ORGANIZATION_NAME LOCAL_PATH_TO_FILE
```

This basic usage will find all the unarchived repositories in the GitHub organization "ORGANIZATION_NAME". It will create a branch named `git-file-adder` in each repo and add a file whose name is the filename element in LOCAL_PATH_TO_FILE to it. It will then create a PR to merge the `git-file-adder` branch into the repository's default branch.

### Adding multiple files

Multiple files can be added by simply listing them:

```shell
cd git-file-adder
jbang GitFileAdder.java -o ORGANIZATION_NAME LOCAL_PATH_TO_FILE1 LOCAL_PATH_TO_FILE2 LOCAL_PATH_TO_FILE3
```
### Selecting repositories

If adding the file to only a subset of the organizations repositories are wanted, use the `-l` or `-r` options to provide either a comma-delimited list of repository names (with `-l` or `--repo-list`) or a regex against which repository names must match (with `-r` or `--repo-regex`).

Providing both a repository list and a regex is not supported.

### Updating existing files

By default, the update to a repository will fail if one of the files to 'add' already exists. Use the `-u` or `--update-existing` option to configure the script to instead update the existing file.

### Error handling

The script will fail if there is a problem ingesting any of the files, i.e. reading them and storing them in in-memory byte arrays for later use.

Once the script begins iterating through the available repositories, a failure updating an individual repository will not abort processing. The other repositories will be attempted.

If processing for a repository succcessfully creates a topic branch but later fails, the topic branch will be deleted.

### Full usage description

The script provides a number of other options:

```shell
Usage: GitFileAdder [-huV] [-b=<baseBranch>] [-m=<message>] -o=<organization>
                    [-p=<path>] [-r=<repoRegex>] [-t=<topicBranch>]
                    [-l=<repoList>[,<repoList>...]]... <files>...
The GitFileAdder creates a PR adding one or more files to one or more
repositories in a GitHub organization

      <files>...          The files to add
  -b, --base-branch=<baseBranch>
                          Specify the name of the target branch for the file.
                            If unset each repo's default branch will be used.
  -h, --help              Show this help message and exit.
  -l, --repo-list=<repoList>[,<repoList>...]
                          Specify a comma delimited list of repository names
  -m, --pr-message=<message>
                          Message for the PR to merge the topic branch to the
                            base branch
  -o, --organization=<organization>
                          Specify the GitHub organization
  -p, --path=<path>       Path within the repository where files should be added
  -r, --repo-regex=<repoRegex>
                          Specify a regular expression to match repository names
  -t, --topic-branch=<topicBranch>
                          Name of the topic branch to create and add files to
  -u, --update-existing   Set to true if any existing file should be updated;
                            false means an existing file will result in failure
  -V, --version           Print version information and exit.
```

## GitRepoLister

Writes to a file the URLs of all unarchived repos in a list of GitHub organizations.

### Basic Usage

Clone the repo locally and then:

```shell
cd git-file-adder
jbang GitRepoLister.java ORGANIZATION_NAME 
```

Output by default is written to a `repositories.txt` file in the current directory.

### Full usage description

The script provides a number of other options:

```shell
Usage: GitRepoLister [-hV] [-o=<outputFile>] [<organizations>[,
                     <organizations>...]]
The GitRepoLister writes to a file the URLs of all unarchived repos in a list
of GitHub organizations

      [<organizations>[,<organizations>...]]
                  The organizations to check
  -h, --help      Show this help message and exit.
  -o, --output-file=<outputFile>
                  Specify the GitHub organizations
  -V, --version   Print version information and exit.
```

## GitOrganizationWriters

Writes to a file Markdown formatted information about all GitHub users with write permissions to repositories in one or more organizations.

### Basic Usage

Clone the repo locally and then:

```shell
cd git-file-adder
jbang GitOrganizationWriters.java ORGANIZATION_NAME 
```

Output by default is written to a `github-writers.md` file in the current directory.

### Controlling the amount of detail

Use the `-d` or `--detail-level` param to specify the verbosity of output. Valid values are:

* `personal` -- Provides the account owner's name (if available), their GitHub login, and the URL to their GitHub account page.
* `organizations` -- The `personal` information plus which of the given GitHub organizations have repositories where the account has write permissions.
* `repositories` -- The `organizations` information plus the names of the repositories where the account has write permissions. This is the default setting.
* `full` -- The `repositories` information, plus for each repository, information about why the account has write permission: because they are an organization owner, because they are a member of listed teams that have write permissions, or because they are a collaborator with write permissions via some other means (presumably direct personal permissions.)

### Full usage description

The script provides a number of other options:

```shell
Usage: GitOrganizationWriters [-ahV] [-d=<detailLevel>] [-o=<outputFile>]
                              [<organizations>[,<organizations>...]]
The GitOrganizationWriters script writes to a file information about accounts
with write permissions to GitHub organizations.

      [<organizations>[,<organizations>...]]
                           The organizations to check
  -a, --include-archived   Whether archived repositories should be included
  -d, --detail-level=<detailLevel>
                           Level of detail to output for each writer (personal,
                             organizations, repositories, full)
  -h, --help               Show this help message and exit.
  -o, --output-file=<outputFile>
                           Name of the output file
  -V, --version            Print version information and exit..
